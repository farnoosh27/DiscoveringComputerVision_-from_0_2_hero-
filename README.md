# DiscoveringComputerVision_-from_0_2_hero-
Hello my name is Farnoosh Azour!
I've recently graduated in Biomedical Engineering at the university of Ottawa, but my thesis concerned Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Classification. 
I feel very passionate about Data Science, and computer vision to be specific, and would be happy to share my experience in brodeing my horizions here with you guys!

In this repo, I will be posting codes and some information, which I'm learning while learning how to work with various computer vision projects! They may include from some basic tasks, like loading images, and continue to sophisticated object detection models.
